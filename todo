1. store buffer (made lsu queue inorder)
    points to remember:
        load instructions can query any number of bytes. you might have the address (stitch)
        load instructions may look independent, but may be dependent on the store
            store reg_b,0(reg_a)
            ld rd,0(reg_c)
                reg_a and reg_c might be the same address

2. jalr prediction (made jalr not update btb (always misses))

3. Add a graph which shows the number of instructions retired at the end.
